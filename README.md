# Ninelivesbooks
I rebuilt the website for my local book store
This project was build as a redesign of a local book store.
I focused on ui design here.
I did a lot of work with figma and affinity photo to get the design the way I wanted it.
I did research on this company to be able to rebuild their site. 
I used several js libraries, as well as sass alongside css.
